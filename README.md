"# Sensation5" 
First-Person Shooter
This project's goal was to develop a 3D environment on PS5 that utilizes the dual sense controller and its immersive feedback. However, as I have faced many limitations due to the unsupported features of the Dual Sense controller on PC, I have used a third-party SDK that allowed me to use the adaptive triggers only. With that in mind, and knowing my game will be developed in 3D and will mainly revolve around puzzles and interactions, I decided to inspire myself with the classic FPS puzzle game “Portal” and give my twist to it. By placing portals, the game provided players with new ways to experiment with the physics and enjoy their gameplay and puzzle. That’s why I have decided to retain this mechanic and link it to the adaptive triggers of the controller, where the further the portal is placed, the more resistance it needs.
